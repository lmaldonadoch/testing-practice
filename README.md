# testing-practice
We made a few modules in JavaScript to practicing testing with Jest.

## Project specifications
On this project, we used Jest to test several functions and modules. We created functions to Capitalize strings, Reverse strings, and analyze an array. We also created modules for a calculator and ciphering strings with a couple of private functions that we didn't test following the instructions on the video tutorial provided with the learning material. We created tests for edge cases such as a user giving us strings instead of numbers for our calculator among others.
